## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the repository owner via email (if available) or via a private vulnerability report mechanism on GitHub.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and strive to send you regular updates about our progress.
